## Introducing CashGPT!

My AI application features an interactive, family-friendly chatbot nicknamed **CashGPT** that helps educate youth, parents, and users of all ages about financial literacy in order to more effectively manage money for generations to come. This app will hopefully have a positive impact on how people manage their money and resources to build more wealth and positive outcomes, check it out!

Additionally, his AI app was deployed using the *Vercel AI SDK* along with OpenAI API as well as other tools. This AI framework allowed for seamless full-stack development from design to deployment and I do recommend!

## Accessing the App

Run a clone of this repo using the Github Code feature.

First, make sure to install all needed dependencies with Node Packet Manager:

```bash
npm install
```

Second, run the development server with Node Packet Manager:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the webpage

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/components/chat.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file, really displaying through page.tsx.

## Deploy using Vercel

Next.js and Vercel are built to be compatible with each other, so deploying with Vercel would be ideal. Watch out for common deploy errors like "no-unescaped-entities" which can be solved by adjusting your config files or encoding your commas and escaped entity symbols.

***Thank you*** and I hope you enjoyed the app!
