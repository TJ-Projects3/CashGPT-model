My AI application features an interactive, family-friendly chatbot nicknamed "CashGPT" that helps educate youth, parents, and users of all ages about financial literacy in order to more effectively manage money for generations to come. This app will hopefully have a positive impact on how people manage their money and the financial market in a way.

This AI app ws deployed using Vercel AI SDK along with OpenAI API as well as other tools. This AI framework allowed for seamless full-stack development from design to deployment and I do recommend!

## Accessing the App

Run a clone of this repo using the Github Code feature.

First, run the development server with Node Packet Manager:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the webpage

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/components/chat.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file, really displaying through page.tsx.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy seamlessly using Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) if you have any issues!
